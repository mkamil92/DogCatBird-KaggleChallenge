# DogCatBird-KaggleChallenge
# CSE669 Deep Learning
### ### This repository implements an image classification model designed to classify images into three categories: Dog, Cat, and Bird. Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning architectures (ResNet-18, VGG-16) the project focuses on achieving optimal accuracy through fine-tuned hyperparameters, dropout regularization and learning rate scheduling. Ensemble Model combined predictions from ResNet-18 and VGG-16 delivering robust and balanced results.

### The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle competition and models are evaluated using Accuracy as the primary metric. 

### This repository includes all necessary details of implementation for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation and visualization making it a comprehensive resource for image classification tasks.
